# Apollo

Apollo is an online submission platform where instructors can flexibly set requirements for
student submissions. These requirements can range from simple checks on the submitted
file structure to test scripts that run when a submission is made.

Students quickly receive feedback on their submission, allowing them to know if it meets
the project requirements.

This repository hosts the web application's source code. To use Apollo, visit https://sel2-5.ugent.be.
